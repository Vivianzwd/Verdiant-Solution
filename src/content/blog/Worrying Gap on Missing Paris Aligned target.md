For the world to meet Paris aligned 1.5 degree temperate target,  global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050


## Global trend on Missing Net Zero Target

While progress has been made in combating climate change, the world is far from being on track to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement,

The UN’s most recent Emissions Gap Report issues a clear warning: Current policies and national climate commitments fall well short of what’s needed to rein in climate change.
Current policies alone will achieve less than a 1% reduction by 2030 and 2035, Governments' 2030 targets will lead to 2.5°C of warming by the end of the century

According to Climate action tracker, The benchmark emissions from a 1.5°C compatible pathway are at 27 GtCO2e in 2030. The emissions gap between this level and 2030 NDCs (excluding hot air) is 19–22 GtCO2e in 2030 (the 'targets gap'), and 24-27 GtCO2e in 2030 for current policies and action (the 'implementation gap'
